<h1>Journey Through the Respiratory System</h1>
<p>The oxygen molecule's journey begins when you
    inhale and the molecules pass through the nasal
    cavity and then goes into the epiglotis. The epiglotis guides
    the oxygen into the trachea past the larynx. Oxygen then travels 
    into the lungs and then goes into the bronchi. The 
    oxygen goes through the bronchi into the bronchioles, 
    where it then goes into the alveoli and performs gas exchange, where
    the oxygen performs diffusion through the alveolus' wall into the 
    bloodstream, where it binds to red blood cells and transports the oxygen 
    across your whole body. The CO2 then diffuses out of the bloodstream, 
    into the alveolus, and then out of your body. The diaphragm
       and other respiratory muscles aid in inhaling oxygen from the 
       environment by contracting and flattening when you inhale, which 
       causes a vacuum to form in your lungs, which pulls in oxygen. They 
       also do this in reverse, pulling CO2 out of your lungs when you exhale.
